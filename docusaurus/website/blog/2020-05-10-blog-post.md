<div align="center">
For the first time we have created a website allowing you to follow the news and all the changes related to our bot.
</div>

We really want to be closer to our community and that's why this blog also exists. Open source for us means making a tool available to everyone, but also helping those who are just starting out as much as we can!


We hope you are enjoying what we are doing and if you need any help please do not hesitate to contact us!
